### My Adjustments for the flipper Zero 



Firmwares used sorted by best ones in my opinion
1. [RM](https://github.com/RogueMaster/flipperzero-firmware-wPlugins) (Rogue Master) - A bit unstable but my prefered firmware 
2. [Flipper-Xtreme](https://github.com/ClaraCrazy/Flipper-Xtreme) - RM but better, stable version with less crashes too much nsfw tho
3. [Unleashed](https://github.com/DarkFlippers/unleashed-firmware) - Stable firmware but i prefer rogue master
4. Custom Firmware i made - Kept boot looping so i had to reset flipper ðŸ˜­
