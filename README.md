### My Adjustments for the flipper Zero 



Firmwares used sorted by best ones in my opinion
1. RM (Rogue Master) - A bit unstable but my prefered firmware
2. Flipper-Xtreme - RM but better, stable version with less crashes too much nsfw tho
3. Unleashed - Stable firmware but i prefer rogue master
4. Custom Firmware i made - Kept boot looping so i had to reset flipper ðŸ˜­
